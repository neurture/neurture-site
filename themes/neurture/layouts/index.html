            Anything! Neurture can target use of social media, procrastination,
            vaping or smoking, alcohol consumption, caffeine intake, gambling or
            betting, impulsive shopping, viewing pornography, gaming,
            technology, and many more compulsive or addictive behaviors.

        <div class="faq-question">
          <span>Is Neurture just for addicts?</span>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            No. Neurture is designed to support any individuals who are looking
            to address unwanted, compulsive, or addictive behaviors that they
            wish to change. It offers resources and tools like meditations,
            affirmations, journaling, and the My Map feature aimed at fostering
            self-awareness and promoting healthier habits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neurture is a subclinical app, meaning it is geared towards those
            whose daily functioning is not severely impacted by their behaviors.
            It serves as a supplementary aid that can fit into a broader care
            plan, offering support and resources that individuals can
            incorporate into their self-care routines. This can prove beneficial
            for anyone, ranging from those looking for extra support between
            therapy sessions, to individuals seeking to understand and modify
            their behaviors better.
          </p>
          <p>
            For persons facing clinical levels of addiction, where the behavior
            significantly interferes with their daily life and requires
            specialized intervention, it's crucial to seek help from healthcare
            professionals who can provide the comprehensive care needed.
            Neurture can be part of a broader, professionally guided approach
            but should not replace the specialized treatment that clinical
            addictions demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Neurture is beneficial for anyone interested in working on
            their behavioral patterns, it is not designed as a standalone
            solution for severe addictions. Consult with a healthcare provider
            to determine the best course of action for any clinical conditions.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            There is an AI assistant as part of Neurture but it is not a
            substitute or replacement for therapy or a mental health
            professional. The AI chat serves as a way to direct users to vetted
            resources within Neurture and is not intended to be used as a
            therapist. Chatting with the assistant is completely anonymous and
            can help users express their thoughts and feelings in a way that can
            be healing.

          <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            You <em>could</em> but chat alone is quite limited. Neurture uses
            chat with an assistant as a starting point and then, based on what
            you share, it incorporates different meditations, journal prompts,
            and goals to include in your action plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, ChatGPT provides minimal privacy compared to Neurture.
            Privacy and trust are critical so we don't be sell your information,
            target you with ads, or train models using your chat data.

        <div class="faq-question">
          <span>Does this replace therapy?</span>
          <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Neurture <em>does not</em> replace therapy. There are many cases
            when therapy administered by a professional is the most effective
            approach to helping someone address their challenges or concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even when someone is seeing a therapist, outside education about
            mental health can provide a lot of value to both the patient and the
            provider. Using multiple modalities, such as traditional
            psychotherapy and mindfulness, often increases effectiveness of
            treatment in general. If you are seeing a therapist or mental health
            professional, always consult with them about any changes to your
            mental health care.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are times when therapy isn't the best fit for individuals. It
            can be too costly for many people, too scary to discuss real issues,
            or simply not conducive to someone's schedule. And even more
            frequently, people have challenges in their lives that simply don't
            reach a clinical need, such as unwanted habits or behaviors that
            don't impair someone's ability to function or just everyday stress.
            In each of these cases, Neurture can serve as an effective piece of
            someone's treatment plan.
