*Effective Date: February 9, 2024*

**1\. Introduction**

Welcome to Neurture. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of information when you use our app.

**2\. Data Collection**

We do not collect personally identifiable information from our users. However, we do collect the following:

- Images of handwritten journal entries
- Audio recordings of voice memos
- Chat messages submitted for interaction with our AI feature

In addition to the data mentioned previously, we have partnered with Mixpanel to collect and analyze user event metrics to better understand how our services are used. The types of data collected via Mixpanel include:

- Generic actions taken within the app (e.g., starting a new conversation, saving a journal entry)
- Interaction with app features (e.g., using the chat feature, adding a log entry)
- Aggregated usage data and app performance metrics

This information helps us improve app functionality and user experience. Note that Mixpanel does not collect personally identifiable information through this process.

**3\. Data Use**

The collected data is used for:

- Converting journal entry images to text (using Google Cloud OCR)
- Processing voice memos and chat messages (using OpenAI API)
- Analyzing app usage and interaction patterns (using Mixpanel)

**4\. Data Sharing**

Data is shared with:

- OpenAI for processing chat messages and voice memos
- Google Cloud for OCR services
- Vercel for temporary storage of images and audio files
- Mixpanel for user metrics

These third\-party services handle your data according to their privacy policies.

**5\. Data Management and User Rights**

Users can view, modify, and delete their data within the app. However, this does not delete it from our cloud storage or that of third\-party providers.

Data deletion requests can be made via email to [privacy@neurtureapp.com](mailto:privacy@neurtureapp.com?subject=Data%20deletion%20request).

Our app retains data indefinitely. Third\-party providers retain data according to their privacy policies.

**6\. Data Security**

We currently do not employ additional security measures or encryption.

In the event of a data breach, we will notify affected users via email and in\-app notifications.

**7\. Children's Privacy**

Our app is not targeted at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from them.
