### Maybe

#### Component extraction

Use Hugo partials for repeatable UI chunks; Tailwindâ€™s @apply inside SCSS can tidy up long class strings.

#### Accessibility

Pair Tailwind with the `@tailwindcss/typography` and `@tailwindcss/forms` plugins for sensible defaults.

#### Caching

Keep the `fingerprint` pipe so users always get the new asset while enjoying long-term-cache hashes in production.
