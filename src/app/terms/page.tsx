        <p className="mb-4 leading-[1.6]">
          The App may use AI services to provide supportive suggestions and help route you to relevant tools
          (e.g., meditations, prompts). AI outputs can be inaccurate or incomplete and should not be relied on as
          professional advice. Use your judgment and consult a qualified professional when needed.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 leading-[1.6]">
          <li><strong>Data use:</strong> We send only the text you provide for AI processing. We do not use chat data to train our own models. Third‑party AI providers process data according to their policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Bias monitoring:</strong> We review prompts and sampled outputs for tone and fairness, avoid sensitive demographic assumptions, and iterate to reduce biased or harmful responses.</li>
          <li><strong>Human oversight:</strong> We design AI to assist—not replace—human judgment. You always decide what to act on.</li>
        </ul>
