## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

### Current Stack
- **Next.js 15.4.1** with App Router
- **React 19.1.0**  
- **TypeScript 5**
- **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **Turbopack** for fast development

### Development Commands
```bash
yarn dev          # Start development server with Turbopack
yarn build        # Build for production
yarn start        # Start production server
yarn lint         # Run ESLint
```

### Known Issues
1. **Styling** - Current implementation uses Tailwind but doesn't match original design closely
2. **Newsletter iframe** - May need styling adjustments for better integration
3. **FAQ transitions** - Could be smoother with better CSS transitions

### Future Considerations
- Consider implementing a proper design system
- May need to add CMS integration for content management
- Could benefit from automated testing setup
